# API Overview

Minecharts API is organised around a small set of REST endpoints that manage authentication, API keys, and Minecraft servers. All requests must use HTTPS in production and include either the session cookie issued at login or an API key in the `X-API-Key` header.

Consult the related guides for deeper details on the authentication model, request lifecycle, operational considerations, and per-endpoint reference material.
